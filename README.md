we want to implement a simple dancing light system with ATMEGA-16 and Basic language

light dancing starts with the turning of the LEDs from right to left

This rotation continues until we press the key connected to the seventh bit of port B

As soon as this key is pressed, the rotation direction changes and goes from left to right.

And vice versa...


The simulation file of this program in the Proteus environment is attached in the repository and you can view it if needed.
